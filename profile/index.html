            <h2 class="sub_title">About Me & My Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I'm a Fulltime Learner and a graduate of a Vocational High School with a major in
                Computer and Network Engineer.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I really like computer technology, especially in the field of software engineering,
                because I see the impact of this field is tangible and revolutionary for aspects of our lives.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">But that's not all. I view Software Engineering, or more accurately, Programming, as
                something truly fantastic and amazing. With it, I can imagine myself being able to do anything I want,
                like being in "god mode" in a video game, because I can do a series of things like:
            </p>
            <ul class="list_items">
                <li class="item_list">Controlling and making everything according to the System or Logical Rules that I
                    want.</li>
                <li class="item_list">Building and Experimenting with something interesting and challenging.</li>
                <li class="item_list">It challenges me to think outside the box and break the rules, but on the other
                    hand it also teaches me to think computationally or logically.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">For me doing all these things is very satisfying and interesting.</p>

                <figcaption>This is one of the characters that influenced me the most, where I saw how he could get
                    or realize his desires by any means, and in the end he was even willing to sacrifice himself to
                    achieve his goal of creating a peaceful and safe world, by creating a common enemy.</figcaption>

            <h2 class="sub_title">Why I Build Learning System</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I am currently working and building my own learning system which aims to make all my
                goals achievable and solve my current problems. <br>
                I call this System <b>Continuously Learning to Survive</b>, because human brain is created and
                working to make human survive, therefore I think I can modified or manipulate my own brain to think in a
                way that <b>Learning is the key to Survive</b>.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">The reason that drives me to build my own Learning System is because I see myself,
                especially when learning something, always feel less suited, not enjoying the learning system or the
                rules that are made, there is always a kind of feeling that I think in some part or step I can improve
                or change the way the Learning System is done, that's why I think I will start to create My Own Learning
                System to make me feel happy and enjoy, but also productive and have measurable results when learning.

            <h2 class="sub_title">Why I Choose SE as Career Path</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">As you can see, the reason I chose Software Engineer as my career path is because of my
                "passion" or interest, but that is not my only consideration when choosing this career or job, because I
                see that there are pragmatic opportunities in this field because our society is now very dependent on
                the Digital World, such as Education, Entrepreneurship, Health, Entertainment, and Others, so when I saw
                this, I thought this was the best combination between my personal interests and the opportunities that
                exist.
